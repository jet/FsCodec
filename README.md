# FsCodec [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/jet-opensource/opensource/_apis/build/status/jet.fscodec?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/jet-opensource/opensource/_build/latest?definitionId=18?branchName=master) [![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/jet/fscodec.svg)](https://github.com/jet/fscodec/releases) [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/fscodec.svg?logo=nuget)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/fscodec/) [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jet/fscodec.svg)](LICENSE)

Defines a minimal interface for serialization and deserialization of events for event-sourcing systems on .NET.
Includes ready-to-go packages for writing simple yet versionable Event Contract definitions in F# using ubiquitous serializers (presently `Newtonsoft.Json`).

Typically used in [applications](https://github.com/jet/dotnet-templates) leveraging [Equinox](https://github.com/jet/equinox) and/or [Propulsion](https://github.com/jet/propulsion), but also applicable to defining DTOs for other purposes such as Web APIs.

  Deltas in behavior/functionality vs `FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson`:
  
  1. [`UnionConverter` is WIP](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/pull/43); model-binding related functionality that `System.Text.Json` does not provide equivalents will not be carried forward (e.g., `MissingMemberHandling`)

# Features: `FsCodec`

The purpose of the `FsCodec` package is to provide a minimal interface on which libraries such as Equinox and Propulsion can depend on in order that they can avoid forcing a specific serialization mechanism.

- [`FsCodec.IEventData`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L4) represents a single event and/or related metadata in raw form (i.e. still as a UTF8 string etc, not yet bound to a specific Event Type)
- [`FsCodec.ITimelineEvent`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L23) represents a single stored event and/or related metadata in raw form (i.e. still as a UTF8 string etc, not yet bound to a specific Event Type). Inherits `IEventData`, adding `Index` and `IsUnfold` in order to represent the position on the timeline which the event logically occupies.
- [`FsCodec.IEventCodec`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L31) presents `Encode : 'Context option * 'Event -> IEventData` and `TryDecode : ITimelineEvent -> 'Event option` methods that can be used in low level application code to generate `IEventData`s or decode `ITimelineEvent`s based on a contract defined by `'Union`
- [`FsCodec.Codec.Create`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/Codec.fs#L27) implements `IEventCodec` in terms of supplied `encode : 'Event -> string * byte[]` and `tryDecode : string * byte[] -> 'Event option` functions (other overloads are available for advanced cases)
- [`FsCodec.Core.EventData.Create`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L44) is a low level helper to create an `IEventData` directly for purposes such as tests etc.
- [`FsCodec.Core.TimelineEvent.Create`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L58) is a low level helper to create an `ITimelineEvent` directly for purposes such as tests etc.

# Features: `FsCodec.(Newtonsoft|SystemText)Json`

## Common API

The concrete implementations implement common type/member/function signatures and behavior that offer consistent behavior using either `Newtonsoft.Json` or `System.Text.Json`, emphasizing the following qualities:

- lean toward having straightforward encodings:
  - tuples don't magically become arrays
  - union bodies don't become arrays of mixed types (they become JSON Objects with named fields)
- don't surprise .NET developers used to Json.NET or System.Text.Json
- having an opinionated core set of behaviors, but don't conflict with the standard extensibility mechanisms afforded by the underlying serializer (one should be able to search up and apply answers from StackOverflow to questions regarding corner cases)
- maintain a minimal but well formed set of built in converters which are implemented per supported serializer - e.g., choices like not supporting F# `list` types

## `Codec`

[`FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/SystemTextJson.Codec`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/Codec.fs) provides an implementation of `IEventCodec` as described in [a scheme for the serializing Events modelled as an F# Discriminated Union](https://eiriktsarpalis.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/a-contract-pattern-for-schemaless-datastores/). This yields a clean yet versionable way of managing the roundtripping events based on a contract inferred from an F# Discriminated Union Type using `Newtonsoft.Json >= 11.0.2` / `System.Text.Json` to serialize the bodies.

## Converters: `Newtonsoft.Json.Converter`s / `System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverter`s

### Explicit vs Implicit

While it's alluded to in the [recommendations](#recommendations), it's worth calling out that the converters in FsCodec (aside from obvious exceptions like the Option and Record ones) are intended to be used by tagging the type with a `JsonConverterAttribute` rather than by inclusion in the global converters list of the underlying serializer.

The key effect of this is that any non-trivial mapping will manifest as the application of the relevant attribute on the `type` or property in question. This also aligns well with the notion of cordoning off a `module Events` as described in [Equinox's `module Aggregate` documentation](
https://github.com/jet/equinox/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#aggregate-module): `type`s that participate in an Event union are defined _and namespaced_ together (including any snapshot serialization contracts).

### This set might be all you need ...

While this may not seem like a sufficiently large set of converters for a large app, it should be mentioned that the serializer-neutral escape hatch represented by [`JsonIsomorphism`](#jsonisimorphism) has resulted in this set alone proving sufficient for two major subsystems of a large e-commerce software suite. See [recommendations](#recommendations) for further expansion on this (TL;DR it does mean ruling out using some type constructs directly in event and/or binding contracts and using [Anti Corruption Layer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/anti-corruption-layer) and/or [event versioning](https://leanpub.com/esversioning) techniques.

### ... but don't forget `FSharp.SystemTextJson`

`System.Text.Json` v `4.x` did not even support F# records that are not marked `[<CLIMutable>]` out-of-the-box (it was similarly spartan wrt C# types, requiring a default constructor on `class`es). The `>= 5.0` that `FsCodec.System.Text.Json` requires does support records, but it doesnt support Discriminated Unions, `option`s, `list`s, `Set` or `Map` out of the box. It's worth calling out explicitly that there are no plans to extend the representations `FsCodec.SystemTextJson` can handle in any significant way over time ([the advice for `FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson` has always been to avoid stuff outside of records, `option`s and `array`s](#recommendations)) - if you have specific exotic corner cases and determine you need something more specifically tailored, the Converters abstraction affords you ability to mix and match from the [`FSharp.SystemTextJson`](https://github.com/Tarmil/FSharp.SystemTextJson) library - it provides a much broader and complete (and well tested) set of converters with a broader remit than what FsCodec is trying to maintain as its sweet spot.
  
### Core converters

The respective concrete Codec packages include relevant `Converter`/`JsonConverter` in order to facilitate interoperable and versionable renderings:
  - `JsonOptionConverter` / [`OptionConverter`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/OptionConverter.fs#L7) represents F#'s `Option<'t>` as a value or `null`; included in the standard `Settings.Create`/`Options.Create` profile. `System.Text.Json` reimplementation :pray: [@ylibrach](https://github.com/ylibrach)
  - [`TypeSafeEnumConverter`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/TypeSafeEnumConverter.fs#L33) represents discriminated union (whose cases are all nullary), as a `string` in a trustworthy manner (`Newtonsoft.Json.Converters.StringEnumConverter` permits values outside the declared values) :pray: [@amjjd](https://github.com/amjjd)
  - [`UnionConverter`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/UnionConverter.fs#L71) represents F# discriminated unions as a single JSON `object` with both the tag value and the body content as named fields directly within :pray: [@amjdd](https://github.com/amjjd); `System.Text.Json` reimplementation :pray: [@NickDarvey](https://github.com/NickDarvey)
  
    NOTE: The encoding differs from that provided by `NewtonsoftJson`'s default converter: `Newtonsoft.Json.Converters.DiscriminatedUnionConverter`, which encodes the fields as an array without names, which has some pros, but many obvious cons
    
    NOTE `System.Text.Json` does not support F# unions out of the box. It's not intended to extend the representations `FsCodec.SystemTextJson` can handle in any significant way over time - if you have specific requirements, the powerful and complete [`FSharp.SystemTextJson`](https://github.com/Tarmil/FSharp.SystemTextJson) library is likely your best option in this space.
    
### Custom converter base classes

- [`JsonIsomorphism`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/Pickler.fs#L49) - allows one to cleanly map a type's internal representation to something that the underlying serializer and converters can already cleanly handle :pray: [@EirikTsarpalis](https://github.com/eiriktsarpalis)
- [`JsonPickler`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/Pickler.fs#L15) - removes boilerplate from simple converters, used in implementation of `JsonIsomorphism` :pray: [@EirikTsarpalis](https://github.com/eiriktsarpalis) 

### `FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson`-specific low level converters

  - [`VerbatimUtf8JsonConverter`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/VerbatimUtf8JsonConverter.fs#L7) captures/renders known valid UTF8 JSON data into a `byte[]` without decomposing it into an object model (not typically relevant for application level code, used in `Equinox.Cosmos` versions prior to `3.0`).
  
## `FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Settings`

[`FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Settings`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/Settings.fs#L8) provides a clean syntax for building a `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerializerSettings` with which to define a serialization contract profile for interoperability purposes. Methods:
- `CreateDefault`: as per `Newtonsoft.Json` defaults with the following override:
  - `DateTimeZoneHandling = DateTimeZoneHandling.Utc` (default is `RoundtripKind`)
  - no custom `IContractResolver` (one is expected to use `camelCase` field names within records, for which this does not matter)
- `Create`: as `CreateDefault` with the following difference:
  - adds an `OptionConverter` (see _Converters_, below)

## `FsCodec.SystemTextJson.Options`

[`FsCodec.SystemTextJson.Options`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/stj/src/FsCodec.SystemTextJson/Options.fs#L8) provides a clean syntax for building a `System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonSerializerOptions` as per `FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Settings`, above. Methods:
- `CreateDefault`: equivalent to generating a `new JsonSerializerSettings()` without any overrides of any kind
- `Create`: as `CreateDefault` with the following difference:
  - adds a `JsonOptionConverter`; included in default `Settings` (see _Converters_, below)
  - Inhibits the HTML-safe escaping that `System.Text.Json` provides as a default by overriding `Encoder` with `System.Text.Encodings.Web.JavaScriptEncoder.UnsafeRelaxedJsonEscaping`

## `Serdes`

[`FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Serdes`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/Serdes.fs#L7) provides light wrappers over `JsonConvert.(Des|S)erializeObject` that utilize the serialization profile defined by `Settings/Options.Create` (above). Methods:
- `Serialize<T>`: serializes an object per its type using the settings defined in `Settings/Options.Create`
- `Deserialize<T>`: deserializes an object per its type using the settings defined in `Settings/Options.Create`

# Examples: `FsCodec.(Newtonsoft|SystemText)Json`

There's a test playground in [tests/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Tests/Examples.fsx](tests/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Tests/Examples.fsx). It's highly recommended to experiment with conversions using FSI. (Also, PRs adding examples are much appreciated...)

There's an equivalent of that for `FsCodec.SystemTextJson`: [tests/FsCodec.SystemTextJson.Tests/Examples.fsx](tests/FsCodec.SystemTextJson.Tests/Examples.fsx).

<a name="contracts"></a>
### Examples of using `Settings` and `Serdes` to define a contract

In a contract assembly used as a way to supply types as part of a client library, one way of encapsulating the conversion rules that need to be applied is as follows:

#### Simple contracts that tag all types or fields necessitating `Converter`s directly and only records and `option`s

The minimal code needed to define helpers to consistently roundtrip where one only uses simple types is to simply state" _Please use `FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Serdes` to encode/decode JSON payloads correctly. However, an alternate approach is to employ the convention of providing a pair of helper methods alongside the type :-

```fsharp
module Contract =
    type Item = { value : string option }
    // implies default settings from Settings.Create(), which includes OptionConverter
    let serialize (x : Item) : string = FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Serdes.Serialize x
    // implies default settings from Settings.Create(), which includes OptionConverter
    let deserialize (json : string) = FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Serdes.Deserialize json
```

#### More advanced case necessitating a custom converter

While it's hard to justify the wrapping in the previous case, this illustrates how one can employ the same basic layout yet override a setting (register a necessary custom `Newtonsoft.Json.Converter` type):

```fsharp
module Contract =
    type Item = { value : string option; other : TypeThatRequiresMyCustomConverter }
    /// Settings to be used within this contract
    // note OptionConverter is also included by default
    let settings = FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Settings.Create(converters = [| MyCustomConverter() |])
    let serialize (x : Item) = FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Serdes.Serialize(x,settings)
    let deserialize (json : string) : Item = FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Serdes.Deserialize(json,settings)
```

## Encoding and conversion of F# types
 
 <a name="recommendations"></a>
### Recommended round-trippable constructs

`Newtonsoft.Json`, thanks to its broad usage throughout .NET systems has well known (with some idiosyncratic quirks) behaviors for most common types one might use for C# DTOs.

Normal primitive F#/.NET such as `bool`, `byte`, `int16`, `int`, `int64`, `float32` (`Single`), `float` (`Double`), `decimal` work as expected.

The default settings for FsCodec applies Json.NET's default behavior, whis is to render fields that have a `null` or `null`-equivalent value with the value `null`. This behavior can be overridden via `Settings(ignoreNulls = true)`, which will cause such JSON fields to be omitted.

The recommendations here apply particularly to Event Contracts - the data in your store will inevitably outlast your code, so being conservative in the complexity of ones's encoding scheme is paramount. Explicit is better than Implicit.

| Type kind | TL;DR | Notes | Example input | Example output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `'t[]` | As per C# | Don't forget to handle `null` | `[ 1; 2; 3]` | `[1,2,3]` |
| `DateTimeOffset` | Roundtrips cleanly | The default `Settings.Create` requests `RoundtripKind` | `DateTimeOffset.Now` | `"2019-09-04T20:30:37.272403+01:00"` |
| `Nullable<'t>` | As per C#; `Nullable()` -> `null`, `Nullable x` -> `x` | OOTB Json.NET and STJ roundtrip cleanly. Works with `Settings.CreateDefault()`. Worth considering if your contract does not involve many `option` types | `Nullable 14` | `14` |
| `'t option` | `Some null`,`None` -> `null`, `Some x` -> `x` _with the converter `Settings.Create()` adds_ | OOTB Json.NET and STJ do not roundtrip `option` types cleanly; `Settings/Options/Codec.Create` wire in an `OptionConverter` by default<br/> NOTE `Some null` will produce `null`, but deserialize as `None` - i.e., it's not round-trippable | `Some 14` | `14` | 
| `string` | As per C#; need to handle `null` | One can use a `string option` to map `null` and `Some null` to `None` | `"Abc"` | `"Abc"` |
| types with unit of measure | Works well (doesnt encode the unit) | Unit of measure tags are only known to the compiler; Json.NET does not process the tags and treats it as the underlying primitive type | `54<g>` | `54` | 
| [`FSharp.UMX`](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.UMX) tagged `string`, `DateTimeOffset` | Works well | [`FSharp.UMX`](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.UMX) enables one to type-tag `string` and `DateTimeOffset` values using the units of measure compiler feature, which Json.NET will render as if they were unadorned | `SkuId.parse "54-321"` | `"000-054-321"` |
| records | Just work | For `System.Text.Json` v `4.x`, usage of `[<CLIMutable>]` or a custom `JsonRecordConverter` was once required | `{\| a = 1; b = Some "x" \|}` | `"{"a":1,"b":"x"}"` |
| Nullary unions (Enum-like DU's without bodies) | Tag `type` with `TypeSafeEnumConverter` | Works well - guarantees a valid mapping, as opposed to using a `System.Enum` and `StringEnumConverter`, which can map invalid values and/or silently map to `0` etc | `State.NotFound` | `"NotFound"` |
| Discriminated Unions (where one or more cases has a body) | Tag `type` with `UnionConverter` | This format can be readily consumed in Java, JavaScript and Swift. Nonetheless, exhaust all other avenues before considering encoding a union in JSON. The `"case"` label id can be overridden. | `Decision.Accepted { result = "54" }` | `{"case": "Accepted","result":"54"}` |

### _Unsupported_ types and/or constructs

The mechanisms in the previous section have proven themselves sufficient for diverse systems inside and outside Jet. Here, we summarize some problematic constructs, with suggestions for alternate approaches to apply in preference.  

| Type kind | TL;DR | Example input | Example output | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `'t list` | __Don't use__; use `'t[]` | `[ 1; 2; 3]` | `[1,2,3]` | While the happy path works, `null` or  missing field maps to a `null` object rather than `[]` [which is completely wrong from an F# perspective] |
| `DateTime` | __Don't use__; use `DateTimeOffset` | | | Round-tripping can be messy, wrong or lossy; `DateTimeOffset` covers same use cases |
| `Guid` or [`FSharp.UMX`](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.UMX) tagged `Guid` | __don't use__; wrap as a reference `type` and use a `JsonIsomorphism`, or represent as a tagged `string` | `Guid.NewGuid()` | `"ba7024c7-6795-413f-9f11-d3b7b1a1fe7a"` | If you wrap the value in a type, you can have that roundtrip with a specific format via a Converter implemented as a `JsonIsomorphism`. Alternately, represent in your contract as a [`FSharp.UMX`](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.UMX) tagged-string. |
| maps/`Dictionary` etc. | avoid; prefer arrays | | | As per C#; not always the best option for many reasons, both on the producer and consumer side. Json.NET has support for various maps with various idiosyncracies typically best covered by Stack Overflow, but often a list of records is clearer<br/>For `System.Text.Json`, use an `IDictionary<'K, 'V>` or `Dictionary<'K, 'V>` |
| tuples | __Don't use__; use records | `(1,2)` | `{"Item1":1,"Item2":2}` | While converters are out there, using tuples in contracts of any kind is simply Not A Good Idea |

 <a name="JsonIsomorphism"></a>
## Custom converters using `JsonIsomorphism`
[`JsonIsomorphism`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson/Pickler.fs#L49) enables one to express the `Read`ing and `Write`ing of the JSON for a type in terms of another type. As alluded to above, rendering and parsing of `Guid` values can be expressed succinctly in this manner. The following Converter, when applied to a field, will render it without dashes in the rendered form:

```fsharp
type GuidConverter() =
    inherit JsonIsomorphism<Guid, string>()
    override __.Pickle g = g.ToString "N"
    override __.UnPickle g = Guid.Parse g
```

## `TypeSafeEnumConverter` basic usage

```fsharp
[<JsonConverter(typeof<TypeSafeEnumConverter>)>]
type Outcome = Joy | Pain | Misery

type Message = { name: string option; outcome: Outcome }

let value = { name = Some null; outcome = Joy}
ser value
// {"name":null,"outcome":"Joy"}

des<Message> """{"name":null,"outcome":"Joy"}"""
// val it : Message = {name = None; outcome = Joy;}
```

By design, we throw when a value is unknown. Often this is the correct design. If, and only if, your software can do something useful with catch-all case, see the technique in `OutcomeWithOther` (below)

```fsharp
des<Message> """{"name":null,"outcome":"Discomfort"}"""
// throws System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: Could not find case 'Discomfort' for type 'FSI_0012+Outcome'
```

##  `TypeSafeEnum` fallback converters using `JsonIsomorphism`

While, in general, one wants to version contracts such that invalid values simply don't arise, in some cases you want to explicitly handle out of range values.
Here we implement a converter as a JsonIsomorphism to achieve such a mapping

```fsharp
[<JsonConverter(typeof<OutcomeWithCatchAllConverter>)>]
type OutcomeWithOther = Joy | Pain | Misery | Other
and OutcomeWithCatchAllConverter() =
    inherit JsonIsomorphism<OutcomeWithOther, string>()
    override __.Pickle v =
        TypeSafeEnum.toString v
    override __.UnPickle json =
        json
        |> TypeSafeEnum.tryParse<OutcomeWithOther>
        |> Option.defaultValue Other

type Message2 = { name: string option; outcome: OutcomeWithOther }
```

Because the `type` is tagged with a Converter attribute, valid values continue to be converted correctly:

```fsharp
let value2 = { name = Some null; outcome = Joy}
ser value2
// {"name":null,"outcome":"Joy"}

des<Message2> """{"name":null,"outcome":"Joy"}"""
// val it : Message = {name = None; outcome = Joy;}
```

More importantly, the formerly invalid value now gets mapped to our fallback value (`Other`) as intended.

```fsharp
des<Message2> """{"name":null,"outcome":"Discomfort"}"""
// val it : Message = {name = None; outcome = Other;}
```

<a name="IEventCodec"></a>
# Features: `IEventCodec`

_See [tests/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Tests/Examples.fsx](tests/FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Tests/Examples.fsx) for a worked example suitable for playing with in F# interactive based on the following tutorial_

<a name="IEventCodec"></a>
## [`FsCodec.IEventCodec`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L31)

```fsharp
/// Defines a contract interpreter that encodes and/or decodes events representing the known set of events borne by a stream category
type IEventCodec<'Event, 'Format, 'Context> =
    /// Encodes a <c>'Event</c> instance into a <c>'Format</c> representation
    abstract Encode : context: 'Context option * value: 'Event -> IEventData<'Format>
    /// Decodes a formatted representation into a <c>'Event<c> instance. Does not throw exception on undefined <c>EventType</c>s
    abstract TryDecode : encoded: ITimelineEvent<'Format> -> 'Event option
```

`IEventCodec` represents a standard contract for the encoding and decoding of events used in event sourcing and event based notification scenarios:
- encoding pending/tentative "source of truth" events ('Facts') in Event Sourced systems (including encoding ones on the way to the store that are not yet accepted on a _Timeline_) - (see [`FsCodec.IEventData`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L4))
- decoding event records from an Event Store in a [programming model](https://github.com/jet/equinox/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#programming-model), which involves mapping from the source event together with contextual information (see [`FsCodec.ITimelineEvent`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L23)) such as:
  - The _event type_, which signifies the event that has taken place (if you're familiar with ADTs, this maps to the Discriminator in a Discriminated Union)
  - the core _event data_ (often encoded as JSON, protobufs etc), the schema for which typically varies by _event type_
  - _event metadata_ (contextual information optionally stored alongside the event)
  - the `Timestamp` at which the event was generated
  - the `Index` representing the position of this event within the sequence of events on the timeline represented by the stream from which one is hydrating the event
  - Correlation/causation identifiers for the activity that triggered the event
- routing and filtering of events for the purpose of managing projections, notification or reactions to events. Such events may either emanate directly from an Event Store's timeline as in the preceding cases, or represent versioned [summary events](http://verraes.net/2019/05/patterns-for-decoupling-distsys-summary-event/)

<a name="IEventData"></a>
## [`FsCodec.IEventData`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/FsCodec.fs#L4)

Pending and timeline Events share the following common contract:

```fsharp
/// Common form for either a Domain Event or an Unfolded Event, without any context regarding its place in the timeline of events
type IEventData<'Format> =
    /// The Event Type, used to drive deserialization
    abstract member EventType : string
    /// Event body, as UTF-8 encoded JSON ready to be injected into the Store
    abstract member Data : 'Format
    /// Optional metadata (null, or same as Data, not written if missing)
    abstract member Meta : 'Format
    /// Application-generated identifier used to drive idempotent writes based on deterministic Ids and/or Request Id
    abstract member EventId : System.Guid
    /// The Correlation Id associated with the flow that generated this event. Can be `null`
    abstract member CorrelationId : string
    /// The Causation Id associated with the flow that generated this event. Can be `null`
    abstract member CausationId : string
    /// The Event's Creation Time (as defined by the writer, i.e. in a mirror, this is intended to reflect the original time)
    /// <remarks>- For EventStore, this value is not honored when writing; the server applies an authoritative timestamp when accepting the write.</remarks>
    abstract member Timestamp : System.DateTimeOffset
```

Events from a versioned feed and/or being loaded from an Event Store bring additional context beyond the base information in [IEventData](#IEventData)

```fsharp
/// Represents a Domain Event or Unfold, together with it's 0-based <c>Index</c> in the event sequence
type ITimelineEvent<'Format> =
    inherit IEventData<'Format>
    /// The 0-based index into the event sequence of this Event
    abstract member Index : int64
    /// Application-supplied context related to the origin of this event
    abstract member Context : obj
    /// Indicates this is not a true Domain Event, but actually an Unfolded Event based on the State inferred from the Events up to and including that at <c>Index</c>
    abstract member IsUnfold : bool
```

## Contracts for parsing / routing event records

See [a scheme for the serializing Events modelled as an F# Discriminated Union](https://eiriktsarpalis.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/a-contract-pattern-for-schemaless-datastores/) for details of the representation scheme used for the events when using `FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Codec.Create`. We'll use the following example contract for the illustration:

```fsharp
module Events =

    // By convention, each contract defines a 'category' used as the first part of the stream name (e.g. `"Favorites-ClientA"`)
    let [<Literal>] CategoryId = "Favorites"

    type Added = { item : string }
    type Removed = { name: string }
    type Event =
        | Added of Added
        | Removed of Removed
        interface TypeShape.UnionContract.IUnionContract

    let codec = FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Codec.Create<Event>()

    // See "logging unmatched events" later in this section for information about this wrapping using an EventCodec helper
    let (|Decode|_|) stream = EventCodec.tryDecode codec Serilog.Log.Logger stream
```

## Strongly typed stream ids using [FSharp.UMX](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.UMX)

The example event stream contract above uses a `ClientId` type which (while being a string at heart) represents the identifier for a specific entity. We use the `FSharp.UMX` library that leans on the F# units of measure feature to tag the strings such that they can't be confused with other identifiers - think of it as a type alias on steroids.

```fsharp
open FSharp.UMX

type [<Measure>] clientId
type ClientId = string<clientId>
module ClientId =
    let parse (str : string) : ClientId = % str
    let toString (value : ClientId) : string = % value
    let (|Parse|) = ClientId.parse
```

## Stream naming conventions

The de-facto standard Event Store [EventStore.org](https://eventstore.org) and its documentation codifies the following convention for the naming of streams:-

    {CategoryName}-{Identifier}

Where:

- `{CategoryName}` represents a high level contract/grouping; all stream names starting with `Category-`
- `-` (hyphen/minus) represents the by-convention canonical stream name separator
- `{Identifier}` represents the identifier of the aggregate [root] for which we're maintaining the data

[`FsCodec.StreamName`](https://github.com/jet/FsCodec/blob/master/src/FsCodec/StreamName.fs): presents the following set of helpers that are useful for splitting and filtering Stream Names by Categories and/or Identifiers. Similar helpers would of course make sense in other languages e.g. C#:

```fsharp
// Type aliases for a type-tagged `string`
type [<Measure>] streamName
type StreamName = string<streamName>

module StreamName =

    (* Creators: Building from constituent parts
       Guards against malformed category, aggregateId and/or aggregateIdElements with exceptions *)

    // Recommended way to specify a stream identifier; a category identifier and an aggregate identity
    // category is separated from id by `-`
    let create (category : string) aggregateId : StreamName = ...

    // Composes a StreamName from a category and > 1 name elements.
    // category is separated from the aggregateId by '-'; elements are separated from each other by '_'
    let compose (category : string) (aggregateIdElements : string seq) : StreamName = ...

    // Validates and maps a trusted Stream Name consisting of a Category and an Id separated by a '-` (dash)
    // Throws <code>InvalidArgumentException</code> if it does not adhere to that form
    let parse (rawStreamName : string) : StreamName = ...

    (* Rendering *)


    let toString (streamName : StreamName) : string = UMX.untag streamName

    (* Parsing: Raw Stream name Validation functions/pattern that handle malformed cases without throwing *)

    // Attempts to split a Stream Name in the form {category}-{id} into its two elements.
    // The {id} segment is permitted to include embedded '-' (dash) characters
    let trySplitCategoryAndId (rawStreamName : string) : (string * string) option = ...

    // Attempts to split a Stream Name in the form {category}-{id} into its two elements.
    // The {id} segment is permitted to include embedded '-' (dash) characters
    // Yields <code>NotCategorized</code> if it does not adhere to that form.
    let (|Categorized|NotCategorized|) (rawStreamName : string) : Choice<string*string,unit> = ...

    (* Splitting: functions/Active patterns for (i.e. generated via `parse`, `create` or `compose`) well-formed Stream Names
       Will throw if presented with malformed strings [generated via alternate means] *)

    // Splits a well-formed Stream Name of the form {category}-{id} into its two elements.
    // Throws <code>InvalidArgumentException</code> if it does not adhere to the well known format (i.e. if it was not produced by `parse`).
    // <remarks>Inverse of <code>create</code>
    let splitCategoryAndId (streamName : StreamName) : string * string = ...
    let (|CategoryAndId|) : StreamName -> (string * string) = splitCategoryAndId

    // Splits a `_`-separated set of id elements (as formed by `compose`) into its (one or more) constituent elements.
    // <remarks>Inverse of what <code>compose</code> does to the subElements
    let (|IdElements|) (aggregateId : string) : string[] = ...

    // Splits a well-formed Stream Name of the form {category}-{id1}_{id2}_{idN} into a pair of category and ids
    // Throws <code>InvalidArgumentException</code> if it does not adhere to the well known format (i.e. if it was not produced by `parse`).
    // <remarks>Inverse of <code>create</code>
    let splitCategoryAndIds (streamName : StreamName) : string * string[] = ...
    let (|CategoryAndIds|) : StreamName -> (string * string[]) = splitCategoryAndIds
```

## Decoding events

Given the following example events from across streams:

```fsharp
let utf8 (s : string) = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(s)
let events = [
    StreamName.parse "Favorites-ClientA",    Core.TimelineEvent.Create(0L, "Added",     utf8 """{ "item": "a" }""")
    StreamName.parse "Favorites-ClientB",    Core.TimelineEvent.Create(0L, "Added",     utf8 """{ "item": "b" }""")
    StreamName.parse "Favorites-ClientA",    Core.TimelineEvent.Create(1L, "Added",     utf8 """{ "item": "b" }""")
    StreamName.parse "Favorites-ClientB",    Core.TimelineEvent.Create(1L, "Added",     utf8 """{ "item": "a" }""")
    StreamName.parse "Favorites-ClientB",    Core.TimelineEvent.Create(2L, "Removed",   utf8 """{ "item": "a" }""")
    StreamName.create "Favorites" "ClientB", Core.TimelineEvent.Create(3L, "Exported",  utf8 """{ "count": 2 }""")
    StreamName.parse "Misc-x",               Core.TimelineEvent.Create(0L, "Dummy",     utf8 """{ "item": "z" }""")
]
```

and the helpers defined above, we can route and/or filter them as follows:

```fsharp
let runCodec () =
    for stream, event in events do
        match stream, event with
        | StreamName.Category (Events.CategoryId, ClientId.Parse id), (Events.Decode stream e) ->
            printfn "Client %s, event %A" (ClientId.toString id) e
        | StreamName.Category (cat, id), e ->
            printfn "Unhandled Event: Category %s, Id %s, Index %d, Event: %A " cat id e.Index e.EventType
        | StreamName.Other streamName, _e ->
            failwithf "Invalid Stream Name: %s" streamName
```

invoking `runCodec ()` yields:

```
Client ClientA, event Added {item = "a";}
Client ClientB, event Added {item = "b";}
Client ClientA, event Added {item = "b";}
Client ClientB, event Added {item = "a";}
Client ClientB, event Removed {name = null;}
Unhandled Event: Category Favorites, Id ClientB, Index 3, Event: "Exported"
Unhandled Event: Category Misc, Id x, Index 0, Event: "Dummy"
```
There are two events that we were not able to decode, for varying reasons:

1. `"Misc-x", FsCodec.Core.TimelineEvent.Create(0L, "Dummy",   utf8 """{ "item": "z" }""")` represents an Event that happens to pass through our event processor that we don't want to decode and/or handle - we don't need to define a contract type for
2. `"Favorites" "ClientB", FsCodec.Core.TimelineEvent.Create(3L, "Exported",  utf8 """{ "count": 2 }""")` represents an Event that has recently been defined in the source system, but not yet handled by the processor. In the event of such an unclassified event occurring within a stream contract we want to know when we're not handling a given event. That's trapped above and logged as `Unhandled Event: Category Favorites, Id ClientB, Index 3, Event: "Exported"`.

_Note however, that we don't have a clean way to trap the data and log it. See [Logging unmatched events](#logging-unmatched-events) for an example of how one might log such unmatched events_

## Adding Matchers to the Event Contract

We can clarify the consuming code a little by adding further helper Active Patterns alongside the event contract :-

```fsharp
module Events =

    // ... (as above)

    // Pattern to determine whether a given {category}-{aggregateId} StreamName represents the stream associated with this Aggregate
    // Yields a strongly typed id from the aggregateId if the Category does match
    let (|MatchesCategory|_|) = function
        | FsCodec.StreamName.CategoryAndId (CategoryId, ClientId.Parse clientId) -> Some clientId
        | _ -> None

    // ... (as above)

    // Yields decoded event and relevant strongly typed ids if the category of the Stream Name is correct
    let (|Match|_|) (streamName, span) =
        match streamName, span with
        | MatchesCategory clientId, (Decode streamName event) -> Some (clientId, event)
        | _ -> None
```

That boxes off the complex pattern matching close to the contract itself, and lets us match on the events in a handler as follows:

```fsharp
let runCodecCleaner () =
    for stream, event in events do
        match stream, event with
        | Events.Match (clientId, event) ->
            printfn "Client %s, event %A" (ClientId.toString clientId) event
        | StreamName.CategoryAndId (cat, id), e ->
            printfn "Unhandled Event: Category %s, Id %s, Index %d, Event: %A " cat id e.Index e.EventType
```

## Logging unmatched events

The following helper (which uses the [`Serilog`](https://github.com/serilog/serilog) library), can be used to selectively layer on some logging when run with logging upped to `Debug` level:

```fsharp
module EventCodec =

    // Uses the supplied codec to decode the supplied event record `x` (iff at LogEventLevel.Debug, detail fails to `log` citing the `stream` and content)
    let tryDecode (codec : FsCodec.IEventCodec<_,_,_>) (log : Serilog.ILogger) streamName (x : FsCodec.ITimelineEvent<byte[]>) =
        match codec.TryDecode x with
        | None ->
            if log.IsEnabled Serilog.Events.LogEventLevel.Debug then
                log.ForContext("event", System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(x.Data), true)
                    .Debug("Codec {type} Could not decode {eventType} in {stream}", codec.GetType().FullName, x.EventType, streamName)
            None
        | x -> x
```

Normally, the `log.IsEnabled` call instantly rules out any need for logging. We can activate this inert logging hook by reconfiguring the logging as follows:

```fsharp
// Switch on debug logging to get detailed information about events that don't match (which has no singificant perf cost when not switched on)
open Serilog
open Serilog.Events
let outputTemplate = "{Message} {Properties}{NewLine}"
Serilog.Log.Logger <-
    LoggerConfiguration()
        .MinimumLevel.Debug()
        .WriteTo.Console(LogEventLevel.Debug, outputTemplate=outputTemplate)
        .CreateLogger()
runCodec ()
```

This adds the following additional output when triggering `runCodec ()`:-

    Codec "<Snipped>" Could not decode "Exported" in "Favorites-ClientB" {event="{ \"count\": 2 }"}

## Decoding contextual information

Events arriving from a store (e.g. Equinox etc) or source (e.g. Propulsion) bear contextual information.

Where relevant, a decoding process may want to extract such context alongside mapping the base information.

For example, we may wish to log (or process as part of our domain logic) metadata accompanying an event, while still leaning on the TypeShape UnionEncoder and FsCodec to automate the decoding.

A clean way to wrap such a set of transitions is as follows:

```fsharp
module EventsWithMeta =

    type EventWithMeta = int64 * DateTimeOffset * Events.Event
    let codec =
        let up (raw : FsCodec.ITimelineEvent<byte[]>, contract : Events.Event) : EventWithMeta =
            raw.Index, raw.Timestamp, contract
        let down ((_index, timestamp, event) : EventWithMeta) =
            event, None, Some timestamp
        FsCodec.NewtonsoftJson.Codec.Create(up, down)
    let (|Decode|_|) stream event : EventWithMeta option = EventCodec.tryDecode codec Serilog.Log.Logger stream event
    let (|Match|_|) (streamName, span) =
        match streamName, span with
        | Events.MatchesCategory clientId, (Decode streamName event) -> Some (clientId, event)
        | _ -> None
```

This allows us to tweak the `runCodec` above as follows to also surface additional contextual information:

```fsharp
let runWithContext () =
    for stream, event in events do
        match stream, event with
        | EventsWithMeta.Match (clientId, (index, ts, e)) ->
            printfn "Client %s index %d time %O event %A" (ClientId.toString clientId) index (ts.ToString "u") e
        | FsCodec.StreamName.CategoryAndId (cat, id), e ->
            printfn "Unhandled Event: Category %s, Id %s, Index %d, Event: %A " cat id e.Index e.EventType
```

which yields the following output:

    Client ClientA index 0 time 2020-01-13 09:44:37Z event Added {item = "a";}
    Client ClientB index 0 time 2020-01-13 09:44:37Z event Added {item = "b";}
    Client ClientA index 1 time 2020-01-13 09:44:37Z event Added {item = "b";}
    Client ClientB index 1 time 2020-01-13 09:44:37Z event Added {item = "a";}
    Client ClientB index 2 time 2020-01-13 09:44:37Z event Removed {name = null;}
    Codec "<Snipped>" Could not decode "Exported" in "Favorites-ClientB" {event="{ \"count\": 2 }"}
    Unhandled Event: Category Favorites, Id ClientB, Index 3, Event: "Exported"
    Unhandled Event: Category Misc, Id x, Index 0, Event: "Dummy"

# Features: `FsCodec.Box.Codec`

`FsCodec.Box.Codec` is a drop-in-equivalent for `FsCodec.(Newtonsoft|SystemText)Json.Codec` with equivalent `.Create` overloads that encode as `ITimelineEvent<obj>` (as opposed to `ITimelineEvent<byte[]>` / `ITimelineEvent<JsonElement>`).

This is useful when storing events in a `MemoryStore` as it allows one to take the perf cost and ancillary yak shaving induced by round-tripping arbitrary event payloads to the concrete serialization format out of the picture when writing property based unit and integration tests.

NOTE this does not imply one should avoid testing this aspect; the opposite in fact -- one should apply the [Test Pyramid principles](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html):
- have a focused series of tests that validate that the various data representations in the event bodies are round-trippable
  a. in the chosen encoding format (i.e. UTF8 JSON)
  b. with the selected concrete json encoder (i.e. `Newtonsoft.Json` for now 🙁)
- integration tests can in general use `BoxEncoder` and `MemoryStore`

_You should absolutely have acceptance tests that apply the actual serialization encoding with the real store for a representative number of scenarios at the top of the pyramid_

## CONTRIBUTING

The intention is to keep this set of converters minimal and interoperable, e.g., many candidates are deliberately being excluded from this set; _its definitely a non-goal for this to become a compendium of every possible converter_. **So, especially in this repo, the bar for adding converters will be exceedingly high and hence any contribution should definitely be preceded by a discussion.**

Examples, tests and docs are welcomed with open arms.

General guidelines:

- Less [converters] is more - [has a converter _really_ proved itself broadly applicable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)) ?
- this is not the final complete set of converters; Json.NET and System.Text.Json are purposefully extensible and limited only by your imagination, for better or worse. However such specific conversions are best kept within the app.
- If the upstream library (`Newtonsoft.Json`, `System.Text.Json`) can or should be made to do something, it should. Also for `System.Text.Json`, if it's an F#-specific, the powerful and complete [`FSharp.SystemTextJson`](https://github.com/Tarmil/FSharp.SystemTextJson) library may be much more aligned.

Please raise GitHub issues for any questions so others can benefit from the discussion.
